      Purpose: Program metadata used for percentage denominators and documentation showing resource type availability.
      Granularity: One row per program x resource type.
      Notes: Will include all program x resource type combinations that exist in the resources table, even if no events have occurred.
      Filters: Only includes program x resource type combinations if more than one resource exists in that combination to avoid misleading denominators.
        For example, two programs have only one resource of type 'activity', but are not native.
    columns:
      - name: program_resource_type_id
        description: "{{ doc('program_resource_type_id') }}"
