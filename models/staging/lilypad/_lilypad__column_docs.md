{% docs event_id %}
Primary key for the event, generated by Snowflake's UUID_STRING() function.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs server_timestamp %}
Timestamp (server-side) when the event was recorded by the backend.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs client_timestamp %}
Timestamp (client-side) when the event was generated by the client application.

**Notes**
- As this is the user's device time, it may not be accurate.
- The  `client_timestamp` may be more accurate in the scenario where the user has closed the tab and the events are sent later when the user re-enters Lilypad. This scenario causes data patterns such as user events with a `server_timestamp` following a pattern that then jumps to a different date, and after the jump the `client_timestamp` values come just after the prior `server_timestamp` values.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs session_uuid %}
Session UUID for the user's session in which the event occurred.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs event_name %}
Name of the event (e.g., action or trigger name).
{% enddocs %}


{% docs event_path %}
Path that indicates what page the user was on.  

**Notes**
- `router.enter` with path = ‘/’ means ‘back to dashboard’
- Often follows the patterns: 
  -  `/resources/{program_id}/details/{resource_id}`
  - `/planner/program_id/{month or folder_id}/week`
- Some `program.resource.search` events may have a `path` that is the search value

Note that users may type paths into the URL that will appear, but are not valid in the app.
{% enddocs %}

The meaning of this value is in the event metadata seed.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs event_value_human_readable %}
Human-readable version of the event value, if available.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs _source_filename %}
Source filename from which the event was loaded into the Snowflake raw table.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs _loaded_at_utc %}
Timestamp when the event was loaded into the Snowflake raw table (ingestion time).
