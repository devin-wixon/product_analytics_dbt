{% docs event_id %}
Primary key for the event, generated by Snowflake's UUID_STRING() function.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs server_timestamp %}
Timestamp (server-side) when the event was recorded by the backend.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs client_timestamp %}
Timestamp (client-side) when the event was generated by the client application.

**Notes**
- As this is the user's device time, it may not be accurate.
- The  `client_timestamp` may be more accurate in the scenario where the user has closed the tab and the events are sent later when the user re-enters Lilypad. This scenario can cause a data pattern where a user's `client_timestamp` values are sequential, but the `server_timestamp` values jump to a different date.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs session_uuid %}
Session UUID for the user's session in which the event occurred.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs event_name %}
Hardcoded, raw event name from the event log.
{% enddocs %}


{% docs event_path %}
Path that indicates what page the user was on.  

**Notes**
- `router.enter` with path = ‘/’ means ‘back to dashboard’
- Often follows the patterns: 
  -  `/resources/{program_id}/details/{resource_id}`
  - `/planner/program_id/{month or folder_id}/week`
- Some `program.resource.search` events may have search value in the path field.
- `auth.login` events may have paths to pages such as resource details when the user opens direct a resource link and its token is expired but its refresh token still valid.
{% enddocs %}

{% enddocs %}


{% docs _source_filename %}
