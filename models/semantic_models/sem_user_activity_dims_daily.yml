      Purpose: User daily activity patterns across all event types and dimensions for flexible aggregation.
      Granularity: One row per user per day per dimensional context.
      Notes: Dynamically adapts to new event categories and supports flexible time grain aggregation.

          Active users are defined by user ID having any captured event in the event logs, including logins and navigating through pages.

          This may be an undercount because:
          - If teachers share their username/password, we will count them as only one. A workaround to be investigated in future iterations is using IP address.
          - Auditing suggests some infrequent user events are not being captured; this is being investigated.
          - If users are given demo accounts (such as over 1K organizations in Sep 25), all of those users will have a single user ID.

      Weekly user activity analysis with flexible dimensional grouping for Tableau.

      This saved query provides n_events and n_active_users metrics at the weekly level,
      with optional grouping by user role, district name, district state, program name, and resource type.

      Tableau users can:
      - View metrics without any dimensional grouping (total metrics)
      - Group by any combination of the included dimensions (drag and drop)
      - All dimensions in this query are compatible with the metrics

    query_params:
      metrics:
        - n_events
        - n_active_users
      group_by:
        - "TimeDimension('metric_time', 'week')"
        - "Dimension('user__user_role')"
        - "Dimension('district__district_name')"
        - "Dimension('district__district_state')"
        - "Dimension('program__program_name')"
