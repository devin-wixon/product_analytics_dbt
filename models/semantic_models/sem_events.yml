      Purpose: Event-level tracking for all captured user interactions in the Lilypad platform with temporally accurate user context.
      Granularity: One row per event (individual event occurrences).
      Notes: Provides detailed event-level data for deep-dive analysis of user behavior, including navigation, resource interactions, planner usage, and application launches. User attributes (role, district) are matched to the event date using SCD Type 2 logic for temporal accuracy.

      Use this model for:
      - Counting distinct users by day/week/month with flexible filtering
      - Event analysis with user demographic context (role, district)
      - Per-user activity distributions and metrics

      Technical: Base model includes pre-joined user context from int_users_district_role_date and district attributes from dim_districts_most_recent.

          Count of unique users who generated events within the filters.

          Active users are defined by user ID having any captured event in the event logs, including logins and navigating through pages.

          This may be an undercount because:
          - If teachers share their username/password, we will count only one user.
          - Auditing suggests some infrequent user events are not being captured; this is being investigated.
          - If users are given demo accounts (such as over 1K organizations in Sep 25), all of those users will have a single user ID.
          - If users access an application through the application's SSO, we do not track events.
